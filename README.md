ChicaCoat

The goal of this project is to create an application where a user can search and find locally sold, gently-used coats for both men, women, and kids at a reasonable price.
GIVEN a user who wants to find a locally sold coat, WHEN the user searches a category, THEN the application will return a database of coats that are currently being sold by customers across the Chicago area.
